This program provides the implementation of the CNN-based model ConvKB for knowledge graph embeddings as described in [the paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2053). ConvKB uses a convolution layer with different filters of the same `1 × 3` shape and then concatenates output feature maps into a single vector which is multiplied by a weight vector to produce a score for the given triple.

## Usage

### News

- June 13, 2020: Update Pytorch (1.5.0) implementation. The ConvKB Pytorch implementation, which is based on the OpenKE framework, is to deal with [the issue #5](https://github.com/daiquocnguyen/ConvKB/issues/5#issuecomment-634568519).

- May 30, 2020: The Tensorflow implementation was completed approximately three years ago, and now it is out-of-date. I will release the Pytorch implementation soon.

- March 06, 2018: Note that our Tensorflow implementation can leverage different filters of different `n × 3` shapes, so we can tune the hyper-parameter `n`. In our paper, we set `n` to `1` for simplification.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.5.0 or Tensorflow 1.6 

### Training

Regarding the Pytorch implementation, you should run ''bash make.sh'' to compile the base package and then use the commands as:

	$ python train_ConvKB.py --dataset WN18RR --hidden_size 50 --num_of_filters 64 --neg_num 10 --valid_step 50 --nbatches 100 --num_epochs 300 --learning_rate 0.01 --lmbda 0.2 --model_name WN18RR_lda-0.2_nneg-10_nfilters-64_lr-0.01 --mode train
	
	$ python train_ConvKB.py --dataset FB15K237 --hidden_size 100 --num_of_filters 128 --neg_num 10 --valid_step 50 --nbatches 100 --num_epochs 300 --learning_rate 0.01 --lmbda 0.1 --model_name FB15K237_lda-0.1_nneg-10_nfilters-128_lr-0.01 --mode train
